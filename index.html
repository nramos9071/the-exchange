                    You're listening to Xadalli explain to the party about her ring. Suddenly, you hear a voice inside your head. "Just as I hoped..."
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="buttons-container" id="question1">
                <p> What Do you do?</p>
                <section class="buttons" id="buttons1">
                    <button type="button" id="dontmove">Don't Move</button>
                    <button type="button" id="freakout">Freak Out</button>

                <p>
                    You stay still. You're trying to concentrate on what Xadalli is saying but her voice begins to drown out and the only voice you 
                    can hear is the voice. "She's finally giving us the last piece we need. Now is our chance. I need you to take that ring. 
                    Get that ring." 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="buttons-container" id="ans2" style="display:none">
                <p>
                    You immediately freak out! You begin to jump around hysterically. Everyone is now looking at you as if you are crazy.
                    "You god damn idiot! Stop making a god damn scene!" You feel anger. But you are not angry. Its a foreign emotion.
                    "I need that fucking ring. Do whatever it takes to get that ring" 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Any checks towards getting the ring will be at disadvantage.
                </p>

            <div id="freakout1" style="display:none">
                Xadalli looks at you disappointingly. Maybe I can not trust you as I thought I could.

                    You decide to try and get the ring. You feel a sense of happiness. You feel like everything is going as you hoped. You feel
                    as if something you had been yearning for is within your reach. But this is a foreign feeling. It's not really your 
                    own feeling. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Anything involved with this ring, you have advantage (unless you freaked out). 
                    Tell your DM "obeyed" as discreetly as possible. If you freaked out then say "Freaked out".

                <p>
                    "Don't you dare think about disobeying me. The consequences of doing so will be dire for you."

                <p>
                    You've reconsidered. You feel a sense of happiness. You feel like everything is going as you hoped. You feel
                    as if something you had been yearning for is within your reach. But this is a foreign feeling. It's not really your 
                    own feeling.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Discreetly tell your DM "reconsidered". You have no help with getting the ring. 
                </p>

            <div class="buttons-container" id="stayedtrue" style="display:none" >
                <p>
                    You begin to feel something within you. At first it was just a pit in your stomach. But it quickly becomes a burning sensation. 
                    Your body is in insane pain. As time goes by, you become weaker and weaker. You fall to the ground in pain. By the end of it,
                    you can barely move. And worst of all, you no longer feel the power you once had.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Discreetly tell your DM "stayed true". Your HP drops to 1. Your pact is also broken. You no longer have any of your warlock 
                    powers.
