                    You watch as Xedalli speaks to Xeleth. Arguing over the future of their planet. You hear a voice come from behind you "Stay calm". You feel a hand touch your shoulder. You're
                    unsure what is happening.

                    You stay still. You try to not react to the voice. "I don't have much time. I'm going to have to leave you soon my love." You recognize the voice. It is the voice
                    Xadalli. "My doppleganger can only speak for so long. Listen closely. When I'm done speaking. I am going to drop something. Pick it up. But don't let your friends see you 
                    pick it up."

                <p>
                    You immediately freak out! You begin to jump around hysterically. Everyone is now looking at you as if you are crazy.
                    Please let your DM know you have chosen this route.

                Xadalli looks at you disappointingly. Maybe I can not trust you as I thought I could.

                    You try to pick up the item that was dropped by Xadalli. You think you can pick it up when everyone is looking away.
                    You bide you time waiting for your chance to pick up the item. You see your chance. Everyone seems to be looking the other way.
                    You bend down to see if you can pick up the item.
